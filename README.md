# Determining-the-points-in-a-concave-or-convex-polygon
In this code, you can determine which points belong to an area, which could be either concave or convex

Hello!
If you work in the logistics and distribution industry and have some familiarity with Python, this post will probably be useful for you.
Suppose you have a large dataset of customers or production units, and you are asked to perform an operation only for those within a certain geographical area.
Your first step should be to filter those points, saving only the ones within that range.
To do this:

Save the "Concavity" folder in the path where your Python is installed, specifically inside the "site-packages" folder. For example, save it in this path: D:\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages .
Now run the provided code. In this code, you must first specify the range of that area by providing the latitude and longitude of those points.
Train your model within that range! And that's it!
Finally, provide your dataset to the model, and it will check if every point you've given falls within that range or not.
It's as simple as that!
